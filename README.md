CMake BASIS
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schuhschuh/cmake-basis.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/schuhschuh/cmake-basis)

The [CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS)][1] makes it
easy to create sharable software and libraries that work together. This is accomplished
by combining and documenting some of the best practices and utilities available.
More importantly, BASIS supplies a fully integrated suite of functionality to make
the whole process seamless!

Additional documentation is available in several locations: 

- First and foremost on the [CMake BASIS website][1].
- The [software manual as PDF](/doc/BASIS_Software_Manual.pdf).
- The documentation installed in the _doc_ directory for offline access.
- The [source package documentation directory](/doc) works in a pinch as well.

Installation
------------

See the [installation instructions][7] or the [INSTALL](/INSTALL.md) file.
Information on where the executables and libraries, the auxiliary data, and the 
documentation files get installed is also available there. For more concise
installation steps, have a look at the [Quick Start Installation][9].
