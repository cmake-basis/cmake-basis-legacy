                  source projects available. More importantly, BASIS supplies 
                  a fully integrated suite of functionality to make the whole 
                  process seamless!

CMake BASIS
===========

The **CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS)** makes it
easy to create sharable software and libraries that work together. This is 
accomplished by combining and documenting some of the best practices, utilities, 
and open source projects available. More importantly, BASIS supplies a fully 
integrated suite of functionality to make the whole process seamless!
